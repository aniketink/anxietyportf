## The Derivation

<LabNote>
  <div slot="text">
    <p>
      We start by defining the geometric constraints of the robot arm. 
      Because the servo rotates on the Z-axis, we can simplify the 
      problem into a 2D planar calculation first.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see in the diagram, the angle <strong>Theta-2</strong> 
      is derived using the Law of Cosines on the triangle formed by 
      Link 1 and Link 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach saves computational power compared to using 
      transformation matrices for every single joint.

## Implementation details

After deriving the formula, I realized that <Handwritten src="/notes.png" inline={true} invert={true} /> was actually zero in this specific configuration. This simplified the Python code significantly.
