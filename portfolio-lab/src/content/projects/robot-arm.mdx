## The Challenge

I needed to calculate the joint angles for the end-effector to reach coordinate $(x, y, z)$. The standard geometric approach was getting messy.

### Initial Thoughts

I started by sketching the link lengths on my iPad.

## The Code

Once the math was settled, I implemented it in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(x, y, z):
    # Calculate base angle
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    return theta1
