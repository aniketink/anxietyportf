## Abstract

This paper explores the challenges of autonomous navigation in unstructured environments, focusing on the application of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. We propose a novel approach that integrates visual and lidar data to improve robustness.

## Methodology

We utilized a custom-built 4-wheeled rover equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar and a ZED 2 Stereo Camera. The sensor fusion was performed using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate a 15% improvement in localization accuracy compared to standard lidar-only methods.
