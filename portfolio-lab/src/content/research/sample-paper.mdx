## About This Demo

### How to Replace the PDF

1.  Go to the `public/pdfs/` folder in your project.
2.  Delete `sample.pdf`.
3.  Paste your actual research paper PDF there.
4.  Rename it to `sample.pdf` (or update the `pdf` field in this file's frontmatter).

The viewer supports dark mode inversion automatically!
