We propose a novel approach that integrates visual and lidar data to improve robustness.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe utilized a custom-built 4-wheeled rover equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar and a ZED 2 Stereo Camera. The sensor fusion was performed using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).\n\n## Results\n\nOur experiments demonstrate a 15% improvement in localization accuracy compared to standard lidar-only methods.","src/content/research/autonomous-navigation.mdx","10172476748274f0","autonomous-navigation.mdx","sample-paper",{"id":89,"data":91,"body":98,"filePath":99,"digest":100,"legacyId":101,"deferredRender":24},{"title":92,"description":93,"date":16,"pdf":94,"tags":95},"Sample Local Research Paper","This demonstrates how to host and display a PDF file directly from your website.","/pdfs/sample.pdf",[96,97],"DEMO","PDF","## About This Demo\n\nThis is a sample research paper entry.
